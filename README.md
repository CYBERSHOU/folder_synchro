# Folder Synchro

This is just a simple script to keep two folders synchronized following the lead of the source folder, while the replica folder just keeps synchronized with the source.

e.g. 
```bash
python .\folder_synchro.py .\source\ .\replica\ 3 .\log.txt
```
The arguments are (in order) the source folder path, the replica folder path, the update delay in seconds, the log file path.
